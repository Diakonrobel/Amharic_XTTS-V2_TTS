# Incident Report: XTTS Training Catastrophic Overfitting

**Incident ID:** INC-2025-10-14-001  
**Date Reported:** 2025-10-14 06:03 UTC  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** DIAGNOSED - Awaiting Implementation  
**Reporter:** User  
**Responder:** AI Agent

## Incident Summary

The Amharic XTTS-V2 fine-tuning training exhibited catastrophic overfitting by epoch 90, with training loss reaching near-zero (0.0005) while validation loss increased to 8.59 (17,000x divergence). This resulted in completely unusable model quality with severe inference degradation.

## Impact Assessment

### Training Resources Wasted:
- **GPU Hours:** ~10 hours (epochs 1-90)
- **Lightning AI Credits:** Significant waste
- **Developer Time:** Hours investigating issues
- **Opportunity Cost:** Could have trained 10+ different experiments

### Quality Impact:
- **Best Model:** Likely best_model_569.pth (epoch 0)
- **Latest Model:** Completely unusable (epoch 90+)
- **Inference Quality:** 3/10 (poor pronunciation, artifacts)

### Business Impact:
- ❌ Cannot deploy current model
- ❌ Project timeline delayed
- ❌ Need complete retraining with fixes
- ✅ Infrastructure proven to work
- ✅ Early checkpoints may be salvageable

---

## Root Causes

### Primary Causes:

1. **No Early Stopping** (CRITICAL)
   - Training continued for 90 epochs despite validation loss increasing from epoch 1
   - No mechanism to detect and halt overfitting
   - **Impact:** Massive waste of compute and degraded model quality

2. **Insufficient Dataset Size** (HIGH)
   - Dataset too small for 520M parameter model
   - Insufficient phoneme coverage for Amharic
   - Poor speaker/style diversity
   - **Impact:** Model memorizes rather than generalizes

3. **No Regularization** (HIGH)
   - No dropout
   - No weight decay
   - No data augmentation
   - No label smoothing
   - **Impact:** Nothing prevents overfitting

4. **Fixed Learning Rate** (MEDIUM)
   - Constant 5e-06 throughout training
   - No warmup, no decay, no scheduling
   - **Impact:** Aggressive overfitting in early epochs

5. **Poor Checkpoint Selection** (MEDIUM)
   - Saves based on training loss, not validation
   - "Best model" from epoch 0 not recognized as truly best
   - **Impact:** User confusion about which checkpoint to use

### Contributing Factors:

- Missing gradient clipping (stability)
- No mixed precision (could improve stability)
- Dataset quality issues (artifacts in audio)
- Inadequate Amharic text preprocessing
- Poor phoneme mapping for Amharic-specific sounds
- Lack of prosody modeling

---

## Symptoms Observed

### Quantitative:
- Training loss: 0.0005 (near-zero)
- Validation loss: 8.59 (extremely high)
- Train/val gap: 17,180x (catastrophic)
- Text CE: 38,000x gap
- Mel CE: 1,994x gap

### Qualitative (Inference):
- ❌ Poor Amharic pronunciation (ejectives, pharyngeals)
- ❌ Unnatural word boundaries
- ❌ Artificial breathing artifacts
- ❌ Poor prosody (cannot handle exclamations)
- ❌ Awkward timing and pauses

- [ ] Add learning rate scheduling (CosineAnnealing or ReduceLROnPlateau)
- [ ] Enable gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)

- [ ] Enable mixed precision training
- [ ] Create inference quality test suite
- [ ] Implement continuous monitoring

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:

1. **Trusted default configuration blindly**
   - Default XTTS config lacks proper regularization for small datasets
   - No validation monitoring enabled by default

2. **Ignored early warning signs**
   - Validation loss increased from epoch 1
   - Should have stopped at epoch 5-10 maximum

3. **Insufficient dataset preparation**
   - Didn't verify dataset size, quality, or diversity upfront
   - No phoneme coverage analysis for Amharic

4. **No monitoring dashboard**
   - Difficult to track training progress in real-time
   - Issues discovered only after 90 epochs completed

### What to Do Differently:

✅ **Always implement early stopping first**
- Should be default for all training runs
- Monitor validation loss, not training loss

✅ **Analyze dataset before training**
- Verify size (10+ hours for XTTS)
- Check quality (audio SNR, artifacts)
- Validate text preprocessing
- Ensure phoneme coverage

✅ **Start with strong regularization**
- Better to under-fit initially than overfit
- Can always reduce regularization if needed

✅ **Use learning rate scheduling**
- Warmup prevents early overfitting
- Decay allows fine-tuning

✅ **Monitor continuously**
- Check every epoch
- Stop at first sign of divergence
- Don't let training run unattended for 90 epochs

✅ **Test inference quality early and often**
- Don't wait until training complete
- Test every 5-10 epochs
- Use consistent test sentences

## Prevention Measures

### Technical Safeguards:

1. **Training Config Template**
   - Created `config/training_config_v2.yaml` with all best practices
   - Includes early stopping, LR scheduling, regularization
   - Use as baseline for future training

2. **Automated Monitoring**
   - TODO: Create monitoring script that alerts on:
     - Val loss increasing 3 epochs in row
     - Train/val gap > 3x
     - Text loss < 0.001 (memorization)
     - Gradient norm > 20

3. **Dataset Validation Pipeline**
   - TODO: Create `scripts/validate_dataset.py`
   - Checks size, quality, coverage before training
   - Rejects if requirements not met

4. **Pre-training Checklist**
   - Created in `training_fixes.md` Part 5
   - Must complete before starting any training

### Process Improvements:

- **Never train without early stopping**
- **Always analyze dataset first**
- **Monitor training closely in first 10 epochs**
- **Test inference quality every 5 epochs**
- **Stop immediately if val loss increases 3+ epochs**
