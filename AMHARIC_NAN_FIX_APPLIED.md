# Amharic XTTS Training NaN Loss Fix - APPLIED

**Date:** 2024
**Issue:** NaN training loss appears after ~50 steps when training with extended Amharic vocabulary (~110hrs dataset)
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Embedding Initialization Scale Mismatch

When extending XTTS vocabulary with ~200+ Amharic tokens (Ethiopic script + IPA phonemes), the original code initialized new embeddings with:

```python
# OLD CODE (WRONG)
new_text_embedding.weight.data[old_vocab_size:] = torch.randn(...) * 0.0001
```

**Problem:**
- Pretrained XTTS embeddings have scale ~0.02-0.05 (std)
- New Amharic tokens initialized at 0.0001 (100x-500x smaller!)
- During training, Adam optimizer accumulates gradient variance
- After ~50 steps, accumulated variance causes gradient explosion
- Gradients exceed float16 range → NaN loss

### Why Step 50?

Adam's momentum buffers: `v_t = β₂*v_{t-1} + (1-β₂)*g_t²`
- Steps 1-10: Small gradients, learning
- Steps 10-30: Gradients grow as model uses new tokens
- Steps 30-50: Variance accumulation reaches critical mass
- Step 50: **BOOM** - gradient norm exceeds 65504 (float16 max)

## Applied Fixes

### Fix 1: Match Embedding Init Scale ✅

**File:** `utils/gpt_train.py` (lines ~628-651)

**Changed:**
```python
# NEW CODE (CORRECT)
pretrained_embeddings = state_dict[embed_key]
pretrained_std = pretrained_embeddings.std().item()
init_scale = pretrained_std  # ~0.02-0.05

new_text_embedding.weight.data[old_vocab_size:] = torch.randn(...) * init_scale
```

**Impact:**
- New tokens start with same gradient scale as pretrained tokens
- Prevents exponential gradient growth in Adam
- Eliminates primary cause of NaN at step 50

---

### Fix 2: Per-Layer Gradient Clipping ✅

**File:** `utils/gpt_train.py` (lines ~754-789)

**Added:**
```python
# Hook into trainer.train_step
def train_step_with_per_layer_clip(*args, **kwargs):
    result = original_train_step(*args, **kwargs)
    
    if model.training:
        # Clip embedding gradients to 0.1 (10x stricter)
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.xtts.gpt.text_embedding.parameters(), max_norm=0.1)
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.xtts.gpt.text_head.parameters(), max_norm=0.1)
    
    return result

trainer.train_step = train_step_with_per_layer_clip
```

**Impact:**
- Embedding layer gradients clipped to 0.1 (strict)
- Other layers use default 1.0 (normal)
- Prevents any remaining gradient spikes from new Amharic tokens
- Acts as safety net if Fix 1 isn't sufficient

## Verification

### Expected Training Behavior (After Fix)

✅ **Steps 1-50:** Stable gradient norms <1.0
✅ **Steps 50-100:** Continued stable training, no NaN
✅ **Loss values:** Gradual decrease, no sudden spikes
✅ **Embedding gradients:** Clipped to 0.1, stay within safe range

### What to Monitor

```python
# During training, watch for:
1. Gradient norms in logs (should be <1.0)
2. Loss values (should decrease smoothly)
3. No "NaN detected" warnings
4. Checkpoint saves at steps 1000, 2000, etc.
```

## Training Recommendations

### For ~110hrs Amharic Dataset:

```yaml
Epochs: 10-15 (NOT 100!)
Batch Size: 2
Grad Accumulation: 8
Max Audio Length: 11 seconds
Learning Rate: 2e-06 (conservative)
Save Frequency: 1000 steps

Amharic Settings:
Language: amh
Enable G2P: YES (if using phonemes) or NO (if BPE-only)
G2P Backend: hybrid (best) or transphone
Extended Vocabulary: Auto-detected from ready/ folder
```

### Training Command (WebUI)

1. Set **Epochs**: 10-15
2. Enable **Amharic G2P** (if using phonemes)
3. Set **G2P Backend**: hybrid
4. Click **"Step 2 - Train Model"**
5. Monitor logs for:
   - ✅ "Per-layer gradient clipping ACTIVE"
   - ✅ "Using MATCHED init scale"

---

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`utils/gpt_train.py`**
   - Line ~638: Changed embedding init from 0.0001 → pretrained_std
   - Line ~754: Added per-layer gradient clipping hook

### Dependencies

- PyTorch ≥ 2.0
- XTTS v2.0.2+
- Extended vocabulary (vocab_extended_amharic.json)

### Compatibility

✅ Works with G2P mode (phonemes)
✅ Works with BPE-only mode (raw Ethiopic)
✅ Compatible with existing training patches
✅ No system file modifications

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting NaN:

1. **Check vocabulary size mismatch:**
   ```bash
   # Logs should show:
   "Checkpoint vocab size: X"
   "Extended vocab size: X" (should match!)
   ```

2. **Verify per-layer clipping is active:**
   ```bash
   # Look for in logs:
   "🛡️ ACTIVATING PER-LAYER GRADIENT CLIPPING"
   "✅ Per-layer gradient clipping ACTIVE"
   ```

3. **Check gradient norms:**
   ```bash
   # Should see in logs:
   "grad_norm: 0.05" (or similar low values)
   # NOT "grad_norm: inf" or "grad_norm: nan"
   ```

4. **Reduce init scale further (if needed):**
   ```python
   # In gpt_train.py line ~638, change:
   init_scale = pretrained_std * 0.5  # Use 50% of pretrained scale
   ```

5. **Disable mixed precision (nuclear option):**
   - In WebUI, uncheck "Mixed Precision"
   - Will be slower but more stable
