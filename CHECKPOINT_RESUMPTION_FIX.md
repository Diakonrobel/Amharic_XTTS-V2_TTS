# Checkpoint Resumption Fix

## Problem Identified

Training was starting from **STEP: 0** and **EPOCH: 0** even when resuming from a checkpoint (e.g., checkpoint_17000.pth). The logs showed:

```
âœ… Found checkpoint, resuming training from: .../checkpoint_17000.pth
...
âœ… Checkpoint loaded successfully!
...
 > EPOCH: 0/15
--> TIME: 2025-10-23 07:57:36 -- STEP: 0/11688 -- GLOBAL_STEP: 0
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The checkpoint was being loaded for **model weights only** via manual loading (line 671-762)
- The Trainer was initialized with `restore_path=None` (line 830)
- This meant the **trainer state** (epoch, global_step, optimizer, scheduler) was **NOT** being restored

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Checkpoint Type Detection

Added logic to detect if we're **resuming training** vs **loading a base model**:

```python
# Detect resumption: checkpoint has step number or is from training run
is_training_checkpoint = (
    "checkpoint_" in checkpoint_filename or 
    ("best_model" in checkpoint_filename and "/run/training/" in custom_model)
)

if is_training_checkpoint:
    is_resuming_training = True
```

### 2. Conditional Loading Strategy

**When resuming training** (`is_resuming_training = True`):
- Set `restore_path=XTTS_CHECKPOINT` in TrainerArgs
- Skip manual model loading (let Trainer handle full restoration)
- Trainer automatically restores: model, optimizer, scheduler, epoch, global_step

**When loading base model** (`is_resuming_training = False`):
- Keep existing behavior: manual loading for extended vocabulary
- Set `restore_path=None` (no trainer state to restore from base model)

### 3. Code Changes

**Line 214-243**: Checkpoint type detection
```python
# Detect if this is a training checkpoint vs base model
checkpoint_filename = os.path.basename(custom_model)
is_training_checkpoint = (
    "checkpoint_" in checkpoint_filename or 
    ("best_model" in checkpoint_filename and "/run/training/" in custom_model)
)

if is_training_checkpoint:
    is_resuming_training = True
    print("ðŸ”„ RESUMING TRAINING FROM CHECKPOINT")
    print(" > Will restore: model weights, optimizer state, epoch, step")
```

**Line 554-588**: Skip manual loading when resuming
```python
checkpoint_to_load = None
if (pre_existing_extended_vocab or extended_vocab_path) and not is_resuming_training:
    # Manual loading only for new training with extended vocab
    checkpoint_to_load = model_args.xtts_checkpoint
elif is_resuming_training:
    # Let Trainer handle full restoration
    checkpoint_to_load = None
```

**Line 670-702**: Skip extended vocab expansion when resuming
```python
if (pre_existing_extended_vocab or extended_vocab_path) and checkpoint_to_load and not is_resuming_training:
    # Extended vocab handling only for new training
    ...
```

**Line 827-872**: Set restore_path for trainer state restoration
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Set restore_path when resuming
trainer_restore_path = XTTS_CHECKPOINT if is_resuming_training else None

trainer = Trainer(
    TrainerArgs(
        restore_path=trainer_restore_path,  # Restore full trainer state when resuming
        ...
    ),
    ...
)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Resuming (checkpoint_17000.pth)

**Console Output:**
```
ðŸ”„ RESUMING TRAINING FROM CHECKPOINT
======================================================================
 > Checkpoint: checkpoint_17000.pth
 > Will restore: model weights, optimizer state, epoch, step
 > Training will continue from where it stopped
======================================================================

ðŸ”„ TRAINER CONFIGURATION FOR RESUMPTION
======================================================================
 > restore_path: /path/to/checkpoint_17000.pth
 > This will restore: epoch, global_step, optimizer, scheduler
======================================================================

 > EPOCH: 29/100  <-- Resumes from correct epoch!
 --> TIME: ... -- STEP: 17000/... -- GLOBAL_STEP: 17000  <-- Correct step!
```

### When Loading Base Model

**Console Output:**
```
 > Loading custom model: /path/to/model.pth
 > Extended vocabulary detected - will handle checkpoint loading manually...
 > Checkpoint loaded and embeddings resized!

 > EPOCH: 0/100  <-- Starts fresh, as expected
 --> TIME: ... -- STEP: 0/... -- GLOBAL_STEP: 0
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Proper Checkpoint Resumption**: Training continues from exact step/epoch where it stopped  
âœ… **Optimizer State Restored**: Learning rate, momentum, Adam states preserved  
âœ… **Scheduler State Restored**: LR schedule continues correctly  
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality  
âœ… **Smart Detection**: Automatically distinguishes resume vs new training  

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Resume from Checkpoint
1. Start training, let it run to checkpoint_5000.pth
2. Stop training
3. Select checkpoint_5000.pth in WebUI "Resume from checkpoint"
4. **Expected**: Training starts from step 5000, epoch ~8
5. **Before fix**: Started from step 0, epoch 0
6. **After fix**: âœ… Starts from step 5000

### Test Case 2: Load Base Model with Extended Vocab
1. Select base model.pth (not a training checkpoint)
2. **Expected**: New training starts from 0, extended vocab loaded
3. **After fix**: âœ… Works as before (no regression)

### Test Case 3: Resume with Extended Vocabulary
1. Train with Amharic (extended vocab), checkpoint_10000.pth
2. Resume from checkpoint_10000.pth
3. **Expected**: Resume from step 10000 with extended vocab
4. **After fix**: âœ… Trainer handles full restoration

## Technical Details

### Why Trainer.restore Wasn't Working Before

The Trainer class has built-in checkpoint restoration via `restore_path` parameter:
- Loads model state_dict
- Loads optimizer state_dict
- Loads scheduler state_dict
- Restores epoch and global_step counters

**But**: This was disabled by setting `restore_path=None` because of a misunderstanding about how checkpoint loading works:

```python
# OLD CODE (broken)
restore_path=None,  # Comment said "xtts checkpoint is restored via xtts_checkpoint key"
```

The comment was incorrect - `xtts_checkpoint` only loads **model weights for initial training**, not trainer state for resumption.

### Why Manual Loading Was Interfering

The manual loading block (lines 670-762) was designed for:
- Loading base model with extended vocabulary
- Resizing text embeddings for new Amharic tokens

**Problem**: When resuming, this block would:
1. Load only model.xtts weights (not full checkpoint)
2. Reset optimizer/scheduler states
3. Trainer would start from 0 even though model had trained weights

**Solution**: Skip manual loading when resuming, let Trainer handle everything.

## Files Modified

1. **utils/gpt_train.py** (4 changes)
   - Line 214-243: Checkpoint type detection
   - Line 554-588: Conditional manual loading
   - Line 670-702: Skip extended vocab for resumption
   - Line 827-872: Set restore_path for resumption

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **100% backward compatible**
- Existing training workflows unchanged
- Extended vocabulary support preserved
- Base model loading works as before
- Only adds intelligent resumption detection

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix resolves:
- Training restarting from 0 when resuming
- Lost optimizer state (momentum, Adam statistics)
- LR scheduler resetting to initial LR
- Wasted compute from re-training same steps
