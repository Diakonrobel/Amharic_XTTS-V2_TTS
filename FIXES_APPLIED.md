# Fixes Applied - Transphone & Number Expansion

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Number expansion now works in Amharic G2P  
✅ **Fixed:** Transphone backend detection with eager initialization and error reporting  
✅ **Added:** Comprehensive diagnostic tool (`diagnose_transphone.py`)

---

## Problem 1: Numbers Not Expanded (FIXED ✅)

### Issue
When inferring text like:
```
ይህ በአውሮፓውያኑ 1959 የተፈረመው
```

Numbers like "1959" were **skipped entirely** in the phoneme output.

### Root Cause
The G2P preprocessing pipeline never called the number expander module.

### Fix Applied
Modified `amharic_tts/g2p/amharic_g2p_enhanced.py`:
- Added `_expand_numbers()` method to preprocessing
- Integrated `AmharicNumberExpander` into the pipeline
- Handles integers and decimals (e.g., 55.5 → "55 ነጥብ 5")

### Test Results
```
✅ PASS: 1959 → ሺህ ዘጠኝ መቶ ሃምሳ ዘጠኝ → phonemes
✅ PASS: 55.5 → ሃምሳ አምስት ነጥብ አምስት → phonemes
✅ PASS: 18.5 → አስራ ስምንት ነጥብ አምስት → phonemes
```

**All numbers are now properly converted to Amharic words before G2P conversion!**

---

## Problem 2: Transphone Detection Issues (FIXED ✅)

### Issue
Transphone backend was failing silently during initialization, even when properly installed on Lightning AI. The system would fall back to rule-based G2P without clearly showing WHY Transphone failed.

### Root Causes Identified

**Cause 1: Lazy Initialization (FIXED)**
- Backends were only initialized on first `convert()` call
- Errors occurred late in the process
- Made debugging difficult

**Cause 2: Silent Failure (FIXED)**
- Exceptions were caught and logged but not surfaced
- No clear error messages for users
- No verification after initialization

**Cause 3: Conflicting epitran on Windows (DEV ONLY)**
```
D:\CHATTERBOX-FINETUNE\chatterbox\epitran\  # Windows dev environment
```

### Fixes Applied

1. **✅ Eager Initialization**
   - Backends now initialize immediately when G2P object is created
   - Errors surface early in the process
   - Faster debugging

2. **✅ Better Error Reporting**
   - Detailed error messages with full stack traces
   - Step-by-step initialization logging
   - Backend verification with test conversion
   - Troubleshooting suggestions printed automatically

3. **✅ Backend Status Tracking**
   - New `get_backend_status()` method
   - New `print_backend_status()` method
   - Tracks initialization errors per backend

4. **✅ Diagnostic Script**
   - Created `diagnose_transphone.py`
   - Tests Transphone at every level
   - Identifies exact failure point

### Testing on Lightning AI

**After pushing changes, run on Lightning AI:**

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull

# Run diagnostic script (THIS WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG)
python diagnose_transphone.py
```

**Expected output if working:**
```
✅ TRANSPHONE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL
...
Step 1: Checking Transphone installation... ✅
Step 2: Testing Transphone initialization... ✅
Step 3: Testing G2P conversion... ✅
Step 4: Testing EnhancedAmharicG2P integration... ✅
🎉 SUCCESS! Transphone is properly installed and integrated.
```

**If diagnostic shows failure, it will display:**
- Exact error message
- Stack trace
- Which step failed
- Troubleshooting suggestions

**Common fixes on Lightning AI:**

```bash
# If diagnostic shows Transphone is broken, reinstall:
pip uninstall -y transphone epitran panphon
pip install --no-cache-dir epitran panphon transphone

# Then re-run diagnostic:
python diagnose_transphone.py
```

## Testing

### Test Number Expansion (Locally)
```bash
python test_number_expansion.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - Numbers are being expanded correctly!
```

### Test on Lightning AI (After Push)
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Test number expansion
python test_number_expansion.py

# Test Transphone (if you fixed it)
python -c "from transphone import read_g2p; g2p = read_g2p('amh'); print(g2p('ሰላም'))"
```

## Workflow for You

Since you're developing on Windows and deploying to Lightning AI:

### On Windows (Dev Environment)
1. ✅ Make fixes/changes (done in this session)
2. Test locally: `python test_number_expansion.py`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. ⚠️ Optionally fix Transphone locally (not critical)

### On Lightning AI (Remote)
1. Pull latest changes: `git pull`
2. Test number expansion: `python test_number_expansion.py`
3. **Fix Transphone** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip uninstall -y transphone epitran panphon
   pip install --no-cache-dir epitran panphon transphone
   python -c "from transphone import read_g2p; print(read_g2p('amh')('ሰላም'))"
   ```
4. Run training/inference as usual

## What Works Now

### With Rule-Based G2P (Current)
✅ Number expansion (1959 → Amharic words)  
✅ Decimal numbers (55.5 → "55 ነጥብ 5")  
✅ Character normalization (ሥ→ስ, etc.)  
✅ Full Ethiopic script support  
❌ Abbreviations (ዓ.ም, etc.) - kept as-is  
⚠️ Lower accuracy for rare words

### With Transphone (If You Fix It)
✅ All of the above  
✅ Better pronunciation accuracy  
✅ Better handling of rare words  
✅ More consistent output  
❌ Abbreviations still not handled (needs separate module)

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Deploy Number Expansion (Now)
```bash
# On Windows
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Integrate number expansion into Amharic G2P preprocessing"
git push

# On Lightning AI
git pull
python test_number_expansion.py  # Should pass
```

### Priority 2: Fix Transphone (Recommended)
See `TRANSPHONE_FIX.md` for full instructions.

### Priority 3: Add Abbreviation Support (Future)
Create abbreviation expander module:
- ዓ.ም → "ዓመተ ምህረት" (anno Domini)
- ዓ.አ → "ዓመተ ዓለም" (year of the world)
- ወዘተ → "ወዘተ ወዘተ" (etc.)
