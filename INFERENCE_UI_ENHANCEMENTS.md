# Inference WebUI Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the Inference tab in the Gradio WebUI to provide better user experience with audio handling capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Reference Audio Input Enhancement** (Line 2639-2644)

**Before:**
```python
speaker_reference_audio = gr.Textbox(label="Reference Audio Path", placeholder="Auto-filled")
```

**After:**
```python
speaker_reference_audio = gr.Audio(
    label="Reference Speaker Audio",
    sources=["upload", "microphone"],
    type="filepath",
    info="Upload an audio file or record directly to use as reference speaker voice"
)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Upload from local PC**: Users can now drag-and-drop or browse to select audio files
- ✅ **Direct recording**: Users can record audio directly from their microphone
- ✅ **Visual playback**: Users can listen to the reference audio before generating speech
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Still outputs filepath, so all existing functions work without modification

### 2. **Output Audio Downloadability** (Lines 2694-2700)

**Status:** Already implemented ✅

The generated audio components already use `type="filepath"`, which makes them downloadable by default:
```python
tts_output_audio = gr.Audio(label="Generated Audio", type="filepath")
reference_audio = gr.Audio(label="Reference Audio Used", type="filepath")
```

**Features:**
- ✅ **Download button**: Gradio automatically provides a download button for filepath-type Audio components
- ✅ **Playback in browser**: Users can play audio directly in the UI
- ✅ **Copy path**: Users can still access the file path if needed

## Functional Compatibility

### Functions That Work Without Modification:
1. ✅ `run_tts()` - Already expects file path, works seamlessly
2. ✅ `load_params_tts()` - Returns file path which Audio component displays correctly
3. ✅ `test_checkpoint_inference()` - Already validates file paths, no changes needed
4. ✅ All event handlers (`tts_btn.click()`, `load_params_tts_btn.click()`, etc.)

### Why No Function Changes Were Needed:
- Gradio Audio component with `type="filepath"` returns the file path as a string
- This is identical to what the previous Textbox component returned
- All existing validation and file handling logic remains intact

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. User had to manually copy file path from disk
2. No way to verify audio before using it
3. No direct recording capability
4. Generated audio could only be played, not easily downloaded

### After:
1. ✅ User can upload audio via drag-and-drop or file browser
2. ✅ User can record audio directly using microphone
3. ✅ User can preview reference audio before generation
4. ✅ Generated audio has built-in download button
5. ✅ All existing functionality preserved (file paths, validation, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Gradio Audio Component Configuration:
- **sources**: `["upload", "microphone"]` - Enables both upload and recording
- **type**: `"filepath"` - Returns file path string (compatible with existing code)
- **label**: Clear, descriptive label for user guidance
- **info**: Helpful tooltip explaining functionality

### No Breaking Changes:
- All existing code paths remain functional
- File path validation still works
- Temporary file handling unchanged
- Model loading and inference logic untouched

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Test**: Upload a reference audio file and generate speech
2. **Recording Test**: Record audio directly and generate speech
3. **Download Test**: Generate audio and verify download button works
4. **Compatibility Test**: Load parameters from output folder (ensures backward compatibility)
5. **Checkpoint Test**: Use quick inference test with uploaded/recorded audio

## Files Modified

- `xtts_demo.py` (Line 2639-2644): Updated speaker_reference_audio component

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Uses existing Gradio functionality.

## Conclusion

This enhancement significantly improves user experience while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing functionality. Users can now easily upload or record reference audio, and download generated speech, making the interface more intuitive and professional.
