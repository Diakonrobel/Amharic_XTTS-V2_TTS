# YouTube URL File Upload Feature

## Feature Request
Add support for uploading `.txt` files containing multiple YouTube URLs (one per line) in the Gradio WebUI.

## Current State
- Users manually paste URLs into text box
- Multiple URLs separated by newlines/spaces
- No file upload support

## Proposed Enhancement

### 1. Add File Upload Component

In `xtts_demo.py`, add a File component in the YouTube tab:

```python
with gr.Row():
    youtube_url = gr.Textbox(
        label="YouTube URL(s)",
        placeholder="Enter one or more YouTube URLs (one per line) or upload a file below...",
        lines=3
    )
    
with gr.Row():
    url_file_upload = gr.File(
        label="Or upload URL list (.txt file, one URL per line)",
        file_types=[".txt"],
        type="filepath"
    )
```

### 2. Create URL Parser Function

Add to `utils/batch_processor.py`:

```python
def parse_url_file(file_path: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Parse YouTube URLs from uploaded text file.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to uploaded .txt file
        
    Returns:
        List of valid YouTube URLs
        
    Format:
        - One URL per line
        - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
        - Empty lines are ignored
        - Whitespace is trimmed
    """
    urls = []
    
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            for line_num, line in enumerate(f, 1):
                line = line.strip()
                
                # Skip empty lines and comments
                if not line or line.startswith('#'):
                    continue
                
                # Validate YouTube URL
                if 'youtube.com/watch' in line or 'youtu.be/' in line:
                    urls.append(line)
                else:
                    print(f"‚ö† Line {line_num}: Invalid YouTube URL: {line[:50]}")
        
        print(f"‚úì Loaded {len(urls)} URLs from file")
        return urls
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error reading URL file: {e}")
        return []
```

### 3. Update Processing Function

Modify `download_youtube_video()` in `xtts_demo.py` to handle both text input and file:

```python
def download_youtube_video(url, url_file, transcript_lang, ...):
    """Download YouTube video(s) - supports text input and file upload"""
    
    # Collect URLs from both sources
    urls_from_text = []
    urls_from_file = []
    
    # Parse text input
    if url and url.strip():
        urls_from_text = batch_processor.parse_youtube_urls(url)
    
    # Parse uploaded file
    if url_file:
        urls_from_file = batch_processor.parse_url_file(url_file)
    
    # Combine and deduplicate
    all_urls = list(set(urls_from_text + urls_from_file))
    
    if not all_urls:
        return "‚ùå No valid YouTube URLs found in text or file!"
    
    # Show summary
    summary = f"üìã Found URLs:\n"
    if urls_from_text:
        summary += f"  - {len(urls_from_text)} from text input\n"
    if urls_from_file:
        summary += f"  - {len(urls_from_file)} from uploaded file\n"
    summary += f"  - {len(all_urls)} total (after removing duplicates)\n\n"
    
    print(summary)
    
    # Continue with existing processing...
    if batch_mode and len(all_urls) > 1:
        return process_youtube_batch_urls(all_urls, ...)
    # ... rest of code
```

### 4. Update UI Component Linking

Update the `.click()` handler to include the new file parameter:

```python
youtube_btn.click(
    fn=download_youtube_video,
    inputs=[
        youtube_url,          # Existing text input
        url_file_upload,      # NEW: File upload
        transcript_lang,
        language,
        # ... other parameters
    ],
    outputs=youtube_output
)
```

## Example URL File Format

Users create a file like `youtube_urls.txt`:

```
# My YouTube video list for training
# Lines starting with # are comments

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_3

# Can add more later:
https://youtu.be/SHORT_ID_4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_5
```

## User Workflow

### Option 1: Manual Entry (Current)
1. Paste URLs in textbox
2. Click Download & Process

### Option 2: File Upload (New!)
1. Create `urls.txt` with one URL per line
2. Click "Upload URL list"
3. Select file
4. Click Download & Process

### Option 3: Both!
1. Paste some URLs in textbox
2. Also upload a file with more URLs
3. System combines both, removes duplicates
4. Processes all URLs

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Easier bulk processing** - Save URL lists for reuse  
‚úÖ **Better organization** - Keep URL collections in files  
‚úÖ **Comments support** - Document which videos are which  
‚úÖ **Less error-prone** - No copy-paste mistakes  
‚úÖ **Reusable** - Same file can be used multiple times  

## Implementation Files

1. **`utils/batch_processor.py`** - Add `parse_url_file()` function
2. **`xtts_demo.py`** - Add File component & update processing logic

## Code Location

In `xtts_demo.py`, around line 2700-2800 (YouTube Processing tab):

```python
# CURRENT (around line 2719):
youtube_url = gr.Textbox(...)

# ADD AFTER:
url_file_upload = gr.File(
    label="üìé Or upload URL list (.txt)",
    file_types=[".txt"],
    type="filepath"
)
```

## Testing

Test cases:
1. ‚úì Upload file only
2. ‚úì Text input only (existing)
3. ‚úì Both file and text (should combine)
4. ‚úì File with comments and empty lines
5. ‚úì File with invalid URLs (should warn but continue)
6. ‚úì Duplicate URLs (should deduplicate)

## Status

- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Not yet implemented**
- Priority: **Medium**
- Effort: **~30 minutes**
- Impact: **High** (much better UX for batch users)

## Next Steps

1. Add `parse_url_file()` to `batch_processor.py`
2. Add File component to YouTube tab in `xtts_demo.py`
3. Update `download_youtube_video()` to merge URLs from both sources
4. Test with sample URL file
5. Update documentation

---

**Ready to implement!** This will significantly improve the batch processing workflow.
