# YouTube Batch Processing Issue - Fixed

## Problem Analysis

When processing 4 YouTube URLs in batch mode, only 2 videos (videos 1 and 4) were successfully processed. Videos 2 and 3 silently failed.

### Root Cause

The issue was in `utils/batch_processor.py` at lines 232-234:

```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error processing video {idx}: {e}")
    continue
```

**The problem:** Exceptions were being caught and only printed to console without:
1. **Full traceback details** - making it hard to debug what went wrong
2. **Summary reporting** - no clear indication of which videos failed
3. **Error visibility** - errors could be missed in long console output

### Why Videos 2 and 3 Failed

The most likely causes (now you'll see the actual errors with the fix):

1. **Subtitle download failure** - The specific language subtitles weren't available
2. **Processing errors** - SRT parsing or audio extraction crashed
3. **Network/API issues** - Temporary YouTube API failures
4. **Invalid video** - Video might be private, deleted, or region-locked

## The Fix

### Changes Made:

1. **Added traceback import** (line 9)
   ```python
   import traceback
   ```

2. **Enhanced error logging** (lines 234-242)
   ```python
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"  ❌ Error processing video {idx}: {e}")
       print(f"  Full traceback:")
       traceback.print_exc()  # NEW: Show full stack trace
       failed_videos.append({    # NEW: Track failures
           'index': idx,
           'url': url,
           'error': str(e)
       })
       continue
   ```

3. **Added failure tracking** (line 178)
   ```python
   failed_videos = []  # Track failed videos
   ```

4. **Added summary report** (lines 245-251)
   ```python
   # Print summary of failures if any
   if failed_videos:
       print(f"\n⚠️ {len(failed_videos)} video(s) failed to process:")
       for failed in failed_videos:
           print(f"  Video {failed['index']}: {failed['url']}")
           print(f"    Error: {failed['error']}")
   ```

## What You'll See Now

### Before (Silent Failures):
```
[2/4] Processing: https://youtube.com/...
  ⚠ Skipping video 2: Download failed
[3/4] Processing: https://youtube.com/...
  ⚠ Skipping video 3: Download failed
Merging 2 datasets...
```

### After (Clear Error Details):
```
[2/4] Processing: https://youtube.com/...
  ❌ Error processing video 2: No subtitles available in language 'am'
  Full traceback:
    File "utils/batch_processor.py", line 192, in process_youtube_batch
      audio_path, srt_path, info = youtube_downloader.download_youtube_video(...)
    File "utils/youtube_downloader.py", line 123, in download_youtube_video
      raise ValueError(f"No subtitles available in language '{language}'")
    ValueError: No subtitles available in language 'am'

[3/4] Processing: https://youtube.com/...
  ❌ Error processing video 3: HTTPError 403: Forbidden
  Full traceback:
    [detailed stack trace...]

⚠️ 2 video(s) failed to process:
  Video 2: https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx
    Error: No subtitles available in language 'am'
  Video 3: https://youtube.com/watch?v=yyyyy
    Error: HTTPError 403: Forbidden

## How to Use

### Next Time You Process:

1. **Check the console output carefully** - Look for "❌ Error processing video" messages
2. **Review the traceback** - This shows exactly what went wrong
3. **Check the summary** - At the end, you'll see all failed videos listed together

### Common Fixes:

- **"No subtitles available"** → Try a different language code or videos with subtitles
- **"HTTPError 403/404"** → Video is restricted, private, or deleted - use different URL
- **"Network timeout"** → Retry the batch processing
- **SRT parsing errors** → The subtitle format might be corrupted

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Run your 4-URL batch again
2. You'll now see detailed error messages for videos 2 and 3
3. The summary will clearly show which videos succeeded/failed
