"""Amharic Tokenizer Package.

This package contains tokenizer implementations tailored for the Amharic
XTTS pipeline. The primary entry point is the hybrid tokenizer that wraps
the multilingual XTTS tokenizer and optionally applies Amharic-specific
G2P before handing the text off to the base tokenizer.
